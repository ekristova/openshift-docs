= Configuring Argo Rollouts to route traffic by using OpenShift Service Mesh

In the following example procedure, you can use OpenShift Service Mesh to configure Argo Rollouts and create a gateway, two kubernetes services - stable and canary which points to the pods within each version of the services, a virtualservice, and a rollout custom resource. The rollout routes 20% of traffic to a canary version of the application, waits for a manual promotion, and then performs multiple automated promotions until it routes the entire traffic to the new application version.

.Procedure

. Create a `Gateway` to accept the inbound traffic for your mesh.
.. Create a YAML file, and copy the following YAML into it.
The following example creates a gateway called `rollouts-demo-gateway`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo-gateway <1>
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway <2>
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
----
<1> The name of the gateway.
<2> Specifies the name of the ingress gateway. The gateway configures exposed ports and protocols but does not include any traffic routing configuration.
.. Apply the YAML file by running the following command.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc apply -f gateway.yaml
----
. Create the services, canary and stable version of the application.
.. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, click *Networking* -> *Services*.
.. Click *Create Service*.
.. On the *Create Service* page, click *YAML view* and add the following snippet:
The following example creates a stable service called `rollouts-demo-stable`. Stable traffic is directed to this service.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo-stable
spec:
  ports: <1>
  - port: 80
    targetPort: http
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
  Selector: <2>
    app: rollouts-demo
----
<1> Specifies the name of the port used by the application for running inside the container.
<2> Ensure that the contents of the `selector` field are the same as in stable service and `Rollout` custom resource (CR).
.. Click *Create* to create a stable service.
.. Repeat these steps to create the canary service:
The following example creates a canary service called `rollouts-demo-canary`. Canary traffic is directed to this service.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo-canary

----
<1> Specifies the name of the port used by the application for running inside the container.
<2> Ensure that the contents of the `selector`field are the same as in canary service and `Rollout` custom resource (CR).
.. Click *Create* to create the canary service.
. Create a VirtualService to route incoming traffic to stable and canary services.
.. Create a YAML file, and copy the following YAML into it.
The following example creates a gateway called `rollouts-demo-vsvc`:

----
<1> The name of the gateway.
<2> The name of the targeted stable service.
<3> Specifies the port number used for listening to traffic.

$ oc apply -f virtual-service.yaml

. Create the `Rollout` CR. In this example, `Istio` is used as a traffic manager.
.. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* -> *Red Hat OpenShift GitOps* -> *Rollout*.
.. On the *Create Rollout* page, click *YAML view* and add the following snippet:
The following example creates a `Rollout` CR called `rollouts-demo`:

[NOTE]
====
When the first instance of the `Rollout` resource is created, the rollout regulates the amount of traffic to be directed towards the stable and canary application versions. In the initial instance, the creation of the `Rollout` resource routes all of the traffic towards the stable version of the application and skips the part where the traffic is sent to the canary version.
====
.. To verify that the service mesh sends 100% of the traffic for the stable service and 0% for the canary service, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe virtualservice/rollouts-demo-vsvc -n $NAMESPACE
----
.. View the following output displayed in the terminal:
+
[source,yaml]
----
route
- destination:
    host: rollouts-demo-stable
  weight: 100 <1>
- destination:
    host: rollouts-demo-canary
  weight: 0 <2>
----
<1> A value of `100` means that 100% of traffic is directed to the stable version.
<2> A value of `0` means that 0% of traffic is directed to the canary version.
. Simulate the new canary version of the application by modifying the container image deployed in the rollout.
.. To modify the `.spec.template.spec.containers.image` value from `argoproj/rollouts-demo:blue` to `argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow`, run the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo rollouts-demo=argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow -n $NAMESPACE
----
+
As a result, the container image deployed in the rollout is modified and the rollout initiates a new canary deployment.
+
[NOTE]
====
As per the `setWeight` property defined in the `.spec.strategy.canary.steps` field of the `Rollout` resource, initially 20% of traffic to the route reaches the canary version and 80% of traffic is directed towards the stable version. The rollout is paused after 20% of traffic is directed to the canary version.
====
+
.. Watch the progression of your rollout by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch -n <namespace> <1>
----
<1> Specify the namespace where the `Rollout` resource is defined.
+
In the given example, 80% of traffic is directed towards the stable version and 20% of traffic is routed to the canary service. The deployment is then paused indefinitely until you request for promotion to the next level.
