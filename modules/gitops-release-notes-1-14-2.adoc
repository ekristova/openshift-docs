== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the New App panel behaved unexpectedly as it reopened immediately after being closed, and typing in fields causes the cursor and text to flash repeatedly. With this fix, the New App panel operates as intended. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5671[GITOPS-5671]

* Before this update, when using the dynamic scaling feature, application controller pods consumed high memory and clusters were not distributed properly across shards. This update ensures that clusters are distributed across shards. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-3465[GITOPS-3465]
